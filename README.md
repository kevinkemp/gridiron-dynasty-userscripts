#What is this?

A set of userscripts that improve the usability of the Gridiron Dynasty website.

#What is a userscript?

Userscripts are open-source licensed add-ons for web browsers that change web pages as they are loaded. They give users the power to make websites do what they want them to, rather than what was originally intended.

#How do I use these?

Depends on your browser.  For Chrome, I would recommend Tampermonkey.  For Firefox, I would recommend Greasemonkey.  Speaking of which, these were only tested in Chrome, but theoretically should work in all modern browsers.

1. Install browser addon (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, etc).
2. Install userscripts that you want to use.  Any script in source that has a ".user.js" suffix is a userscript.  How you install a userscript is dependent upon your addon, but for Tampermonkey, it's as easy as clicking the file above and then clicking the "Raw" link.  Tampermonkey will realize that it's a userscript and prompt you to install it.
3. Potentially, you will need to restart your browser.
4. Go to the webpage and enjoy.
